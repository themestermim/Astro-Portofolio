        description: 'I worked as a frontend developer on Drfori, a Nuxt.js-based medical platform that was originally developed by another team. My role involved redesigning and optimizing the existing codebase page by page. I restructured the entire frontend architecture to make it more maintainable and scalable, introducing Pinia for state management to handle shared data and logic between components and pages more efficiently. I also replaced the previous styling approach with Tailwind CSS to create a consistent, responsive, and modern user interface. The project was built with Server-Side Rendering (SSR), which I maintained and enhanced to ensure fast page loads and excellent SEO performance. My contributions significantly improved the overall performance, developer experience, and code quality of the platform.',

The goal was to create a website builder for automotive companies, enabling them to generate customized designs in the shortest time possible. In this project, we implemented WordPress as a factory and utilized the ACF plugin to explore its extensive capabilities. For styling, we leveraged Sass to enhance the development process. One of the main challenges was learning WordPress development with a programming-focused approach (rather than using tools like Elementor) and working with PHP. For the first time, I designed custom APIs using PHP to manage and process data, which went beyond my previous front-end experience. Although I wasn’t highly skilled at the time, I successfully learned the structure of WordPress back-end development and applied it effectively in this project.',

Through close collaboration with the technical manager and focused research, we achieved successful results. In addition to optimizing performance and SEO, the project was also designed as a PWA (Progressive Web Application), enabling offline use of the application. I learned how to implement app installation on various devices and laid the groundwork for sending push notifications using Pusher JS as the notification provider. Along with performance and SEO optimization, I delved deeper into Service Workers. This project provided an opportunity to thoroughly familiarize myself with the fundamentals and lifecycle of Service Workers. I was able to apply this technology to deliver a smoother and more efficient user experience.
